# PRG 200: Introduction to Python – Course Project

Welcome to the **PRG 200: Introduction to Python** course project!  
This project will help you apply your Python programming knowledge to build a **real-world application** — from idea to deployment.  

---

## **Objective**
By the end of this project, you will:
- Design and implement a complete Python application  
- Learn to use frameworks like **Streamlit**, **Flask**, or **Tkinter**  
- Deploy your project online using **Streamlit Cloud**, **PythonAnywhere**, or **Replit**  
- Present your application and reflect on your learning journey  

---

## **Project Timeline**

### **Week 2: Project Idea Defense**
- Choose your project topic (e.g., medical record app, expense tracker, grade manager)
- Define your objectives and scope  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - 1-page Project Proposal  
  - 2–3 minute Idea Defense Presentation

---

### **Week 3: Literature Review & Code Review**
- Review 2–3 similar beginner-level Python projects online  
- Analyze their code logic and design  
- Identify how your project will be different or improved  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - 1–2 page Literature & Code Review Summary

---

### **Week 4: Pseudocode & Flowchart**
- Write pseudocode outlining your program logic  
- Draw a flowchart showing how your program processes data  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Pseudocode document  
  - Flowchart diagram

---

### **Week 5: Core Logic Implementation (CLI Prototype)**
- Implement your project’s **core functionality** using Python basics  
  (variables, lists/dictionaries, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Build a **command-line version (CLI)** of your app  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Working CLI prototype (`.py` file)

---

### **Week 6: User Interface (Streamlit / Flask / Tkinter)**
- Choose one UI framework:
  - **Streamlit** → easiest web-based interface  
  - **Flask** → web app with routes and templates  
  - **Tkinter** → simple desktop GUI  
- Connect your Python logic to the interface  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Basic UI application (Version 1)

---

### **Week 7: Application Finalization & Testing**
- Refine and test the full application  
- Ensure correct data handling and interaction  
- Prepare for deployment  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Final Working Application (local version)

---

### **Week 8: Deployment, Presentation & Submission**
- Deploy your app using any **free platform:**
  - [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
  - [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
  - [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- Present your app in class (5–7 minutes)  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Live App Link  
  - Final Project Report (3–5 pages)  
  - Presentation Slides

---

## **Sample Project Ideas**
- Personal Expense Tracker  
- Medical Record Management System  
- Student Grade Manager  
- Contact Book App  
- Simple Inventory Manager  
- Quiz or Flashcard Application
